# Pacman

A game of Pacman with a minimal design, that can be played on the browser. Made using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The data is stored in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). If you know what that means, you can have any highscore you want ;)

> The game is not responsive, only desktop view has been styled (You won't be able to play it on your mobile)
